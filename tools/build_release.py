    readme = f"""# {pack['title']}

Four original note-only MIDI studies for producers who need the musical structure documented as carefully as the files.

**Live catalog:** https://mizcausevic-dev.github.io/{public_slug}/

This is a bounded symbolic-composition release, not a sample pack, recording, or claim to define a genre, its history or its communities.

## The studies

| Study | Pitch collection | Frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
{study_rows}

The release contains 28 study MIDI files: six Format 0 role exports and one Format 1 combined arrangement per study. It also contains canonical event CSVs, structural/harmonic/drum-map records, patch recipes, checksums, an original SVG cover, a simple-synthesis preview, draft editorial copy and one ZIP.

## Start here

1. Open the live catalog or download `downloads/{pack['slug']}-midi.zip`.
2. Choose either a combined arrangement or the separate part files. **Do not stack the part files on the combined file.**
3. Read `catalog/patch-recipes.json` for channel/role mappings, and `checks/validation-report.json` before relying on a technical claim.

## File contract

- 480 PPQ, 4/4, {pack['bpm']} BPM, 61,440 end ticks per study.
- Five pitched roles use user-facing channels 1–5 (wire values 0–4); drums use user-facing channel 10 (wire value 9).
- Bass and principal melody are monophonic. No program changes, controllers, pitch bends, keyswitches or SysEx are present.
- {pack['guardrail']}

## Technical verification boundary

The validator reopens final bytes and checks MIDI count, Format 0/1 shape, PPQ, tempo, meter, named combined tracks, event timing, note pairing, role channels, monophony, same-pitch overlap, CSV parity, region coverage, drum-map coverage, ZIP paths, preview decode and checksum records. It also runs a known-invalid same-pitch-overlap fixture.

It does **not** certify groove, musical quality, commercial suitability, physical playability, cultural authenticity or copyright clearance. Duplicate-motif results are only a bounded structural review. Automated checks may pass while human listening remains unperformed.

The preview is generated from the first study's committed MIDI with a documented simple synthesizer. It is a **preview, not a master**.

## Rebuild

```powershell
python tools/build_release.py --pack {pack['slug']}
python tools/validate_release.py
python -m http.server 4173
```

`tools/build_footwork.py` is the local MIDI byte engine retained from the initial release; `tools/build_release.py` is the profile-driven release writer. The committed outputs, rather than an external service, are the build evidence.
